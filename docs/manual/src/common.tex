\section{Introduction}

\par
Open Game Module is a open source expansion card for the Colecovision. This module is Super Game Module (SGM) compatable.
This means all SGM games will run when this module is used with a Colecovision. The sound is expanded with a Yamaha YMZ284
instead of the GI AY chip.

  \item 32 KB of RAM
  \item YMZ284 Sound Chip

\section{Building}

\par
This document assumes some Electrical Engineering knowledge. Building circuits is not
trivial due to the mix of SMD and through hole components. What follow are general
steps to build the Mini Colecovision

\begin{itemize}
  \item Create PCB from schematic/gerber/open\_game\_module.zip
  \item Populate PCB
  \item Power up and program CPLD
  \item Build your own case
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Directory Guide}

\par
Below highlights important folders from the root of the open\_game\_module.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{docs} Contains all documentation related to this project.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{datasheets} Contains all datasheets for components.
      \item \textbf{manual} Contains user manual and github page that are generated from the latex sources.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{img} Contains images of the project
  \item \textbf{schematic} KiCAD v8.X schematic and PCB designs
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{gerber} Contains gerber files and archives for production.
      \item \textbf{pdf} PDF schematic
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{src} CPLD firmware source
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{open\_game\_module} Contains verilog source code and constraits
      \item \textbf{quartus13sp01} Quartus project used to generate firmware.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies needed to build the firmware and PCB for the system.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quartus 13.0 sp1
  \item python 3.X
  \item KiCAD v8.X
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/files_fusesoc.tex}

\subsubsection{Fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is used for the simulation target only. There are no build targets due to the use of Quartus 13.0sp1.
This makes the use of it a bit silly. It does make it easier to use in future projects where the RAM,ROM,CPU,VDP,
and Sound chips are also IP cores.

\input{src/fusesoc/targets_fusesoc.tex}

\subsubsection{Quartus}
\par
This project uses the last version of Quartus that supports the MAX7000S series. The version is 13.0sp1.
The project is located at src/quartus13sp01/. Once you have the project open please follow the softwares steps
for building and programming the CPLD bitfile.

\subsection{PCB}

The top has all the components of the circuit.

\end{figure}

\subsection{3D Printed Case}

\par
The 3D printed case has been tested on two different printers. It has only been tested with ABS filament.
The parts list for the 3D printed case has the STL file name in the value and the XXX.X value is the scale size.
In general I recommend the following steps for assembly.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Bottom, sit pcb aligned to screw holes.
  \item Top, sit top half on top and install screws.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CPLD Programming}

\par
There is one device that need to be programmed which is the CPLD (complex programmable logic device).
This is programmed with quartus using the JTAG header to upload the bitfile.
\par
Quartus 13.0sp1 is the easiest way to build and program the MAX7000 CPLD. You will need an altera blaster.
I recommend the chinese clone blasters, they actually worked the best. While the worst was the Terasic blaster
which did not work at all. As for instructions on how to program it in Quartus, please see the software for details.

\section{Usage}

\subsection{Console}
\par
The expansion module must be firmly inserted into the expansion connector of the Colecovision. If you have issues, be sure
to clean the connectors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Open Expansion Cover} \includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/SPARKLETRON.png}
  \item \textbf{Insert Open Game Module} \includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{img/SPARKLETRON.png}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software Programming}
\par
Module Documentation has in\-depth details for using the open game module and register bits. You could do this in many different ways, but
having the SDCC compiler know ahead of time that the RAM is there works well for me. There are different stragies that could be done for this
but I feel this is the simplest way. Other methods can provide better detection of the OGM. The psudo code steps are as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Setup expansion RAM, (NOTE COULD CHECK IF REGISTER VALUE IS EQUAL TO THE DEFAULT TO VERIFY SGM)
  \item Setup IRQS
  \item Copy IRQs to RAM where ROM jumps used to be.
  \item Setup Sound CHIP, (READ BACK TO CHECK EXISTANCE)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Assembly Code For RAM Init}

\par
This brief assembly code doesn't actually check for the SGM it simply enables the ram registers, sets the irqs, and starts main. This code is taken
from RODAC and isn't complete, see RODAC coleco\_sgm arch crt0.s for complete code.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}]

_SGM_BIOS_SWAP_PORT   .equ 0x007F

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{C Code for SDCC}

\par
The code below is based on using SDCC 4.X.X as the C complier with a custom crt0.s. Essentially for the sound chip you
need to communicate with it by writing to the ports a address, then the data. You can also read from the ports to
verify the chip exists and that the OGM is working. Though for the OGM its chip does not have a read function. It is
emulated for registers 0, 2, and 4 (0=1, 2=3, and 4=5) in the CPLD so all opcode/team pixelboy games will startup correctly.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]

#define GI_SND_CP_ADDR    0x50
#define GI_SND_WDATA_ADDR 0x51
#define GI_SND_RDATA_ADDR 0x52

__sfr __at(GI_SND_CP_ADDR)    GI_SND_CP_PORT;
__sfr __at(GI_SND_WDATA_ADDR) GI_SND_WDATA_PORT;
__sfr __at(GI_SND_RDATA_ADDR) GI_SND_RDATA_PORT;

/*** send address to chip ***/
inline void sendAddr(uint8_t addr)
{
  di();

  GI_SND_CP_PORT = addr;

  ei();
}

/*** send data to chip ***/
inline void sendData(uint8_t data)
{
  di();

  GI_SND_WDATA_PORT = data;

  ei();
}

/*** send data to chip ***/
inline void readData(uint8_t data)
{
  di();

  data = GI_SND_RDATA_PORT;

  ei();
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Architecture}

\par
The OGM architecture emulates the Super Game Module. This is done with a CPLD which performs the RAM (32KiB) and sound (YMZ284) selects. It also caches the the sound writes for later reads. For the RAM selects this is done by emulating the original 74LS138 decoders. This is used to disable the internal RAM with the register at 0x53 by writing one to bit zero. This will remove the internal 1KiB and extend the console to 24KiB. Then to swap out the ROM for RAM for an additional 8KiB the register 0x7F has a zero written to bit one (default value for the register is 0x0F). For the sound, all writes have an address cache to store the last address requested. This is due to the architecture of the original chip where the address is selected and then a read is performed. With the address set a subset of the register addresses are mapped to cache registers on the CPLD. See the section after this one for the mapping. This allows the cheaper YMZ284 to be used for sound generation. There are two resistors used to pad the output of the YMZ284 for acceptable levels when mixed with the original in the console. The console internally has a DC blocking capacitor, so no additional capacitors are needed.

\subsection{Fix for opcode games}

Opcode super game module mega cart games have a particular check for the sound chip in there startup routine.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set AY register address to 0x00
  \item Write the value 0xAA to AY (register 0x00).
  \item Set AY register address to 0x02
  \item Write the value 0x55 to AY (register 0x02).
  \item Set AY register address to 0x00
  \item Read the value from AY (register 0x00).
  \item Compare to value originally written (0xAA), fail if not matching
  \item Set AY register address to 0x02
  \item Read the value from AY (register 0x02).
  \item Compare to value originally written (0x55), fail if not matching.
\end{enumerate}

The hack fix for my setup is to only have 4 8 bit regiters for 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7. The mapping is
AY Software Register ADDRESS => Cache Register ADDRESS

\begin{itemize}
  \item 0 => 0
  \item 1 => 0
  \item 2 => 1
  \item 3 => 1
  \item 4 => 2
  \item 5 => 2
  \item 6 => 3
  \item 7 => 3
\end{itemize}
